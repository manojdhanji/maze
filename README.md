# maze
This uses left-turn and/or right-turn algorithms
It reads a (maze.txt) file from the file system (current location)
There are several text files (named maze_x.txt) added to this repository. To execute the maze.exe download anyone of the maze_x.txt and rename it to maze.txt. The maze.txt should be downloaded to the same location as the maze.exe
